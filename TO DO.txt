Portfolio to-do list:

- Add fontawesome "sun" and "moon" icon onto the dark mode slider
- Fix "Web Developer" in the title not being affected by its "flavor" class
- Make the website remember your dark/light mode preference
- Make website more responsive as to work on mobile devices

Minesweeper:

- Make the reset button actually just reset the board rather than the whole page
- Add slider to change amount of bombs (range of like 0-32 probably) this will likely require the new board reset code
